    <li>1 (8 ounce) packlage lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 (26.5 ounce) cans of spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
    <li>2 (15) ounce containes part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon italian seasonign, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>

  <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
  <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; <br>
    reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no <br>
    longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
  <p>While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook <br>
    lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to <br>
    the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
  <p>Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot <br>
    butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 5</strong></h4>
  <p>Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the <br>
    Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 6</strong></h4>
  <p>Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese together in another bowl. Spread a thin <br>
     layer on the bottom of a glass 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, spread chicken mixture <br>
     on top, then add another thin layer of the sauce mixture. Repeat, leaving a final layer of noodles on top.<br>
     Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Cheddar cheese on top.</p>

  <h4><strong>Step 7</strong></h4>
  <p>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.</p>
